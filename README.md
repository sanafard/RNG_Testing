## Decelect's Project 

We enhance trust and fairness through a zero-knowledge quantum mimicking process. This process allows for tamper-proof random generation that can be recalled in the future to demonstrate the same result as proof without saving any data. Creating the future of gambling and chance generation algorithms is what we are doing in Decelect's Project Dame.

## RNG Testing

As part of this project, I am responsible for the Random Number Generation (RNG) testing. This involves ensuring the integrity and reliability of the random generation process to maintain the project's commitment to fairness and trust.
